/**
 * Switch Polaris's anti-cheat on for the Minecraft servers that can run it and
 * nobody decided about - written for their next start, never forced into a
 * running one.
 *
 * Polaris runs it on its own schedule (see `lib/cron/scheduler`). The route stays
 * for an operator who would rather drive the timing themselves.
 *
 * Disabled unless POLARIS_CRON_SECRET is set, and callers present it as a bearer
 * token (or an x-cron-key header). Node runtime for Prisma.
