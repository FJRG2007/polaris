/**
 * Put the Polaris mod on every Minecraft server Polaris has a mod build for,

 * Polaris runs it on its own schedule (see `lib/cron/scheduler`). The route stays

 *
 * Disabled unless POLARIS_CRON_SECRET is set, and callers present it as a bearer
 * token (or an x-cron-key header). Node runtime for Prisma.
